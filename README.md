🛡️ Phishing Link Detection System using Machine Learning:-

This project is a Machine Learning-based Phishing Link Detection System that aims to identify and classify URLs as either legitimate or phishing. It uses various URL features and a trained ML model to detect potential threats in real time.

🧠 Objective:-

The main goal of this system is to combat cyber threats by detecting malicious URLs and preventing users from falling victim to phishing attacks. This system can be integrated into browsers, email clients, or cybersecurity software.

🚀 Features:-

Detects phishing URLs using machine learning classification
Extracts and analyzes URL-based features
High accuracy with trained ML models
Can be extended as a browser extension or web service
Lightweight and fast prediction

🛠 Technologies Used:-

Python
Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation
Scikit-learn – Machine learning models
Tkinter / Flask (optional) – UI for desktop/web interface
Jupyter Notebook – Model training and evaluation

🔍 Dataset:-

A publicly available dataset containing labeled URLs (phishing or legitimate)
Features include:
URL length
Use of HTTPS
Presence of IP address
Use of special characters
Number of subdomains
And more

🧪 ML Models Used:-

The following machine learning models were experimented with:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Naive Bayes
The best performing model was selected based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

📈 Performance:-

Accuracy: ~89% (update with your actual result)
Precision: ~91%

🧰 How to Use:-

Clone this repository
Install required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the notebook or Python script to test URLs
Input a URL to check whether it's safe or a phishing attempt


📚 Learning Outcomes:-

Application of machine learning in cybersecurity
Feature engineering for URLs
Understanding classification techniques
Real-world problem-solving using AI

🔒 Future Improvements:-

Deploy as a real-time API or browser extension
Use deep learning models for better accuracy
Integrate threat intelligence feeds
Add support for real-time web scraping and URL scanning
